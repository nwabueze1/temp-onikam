          '<p>Many of you messaged me on Instagram after I shared my Power Bowls on IG Stories asking for the recipe, so here it is! I love this recipe for so many reasons. You’ll see from the recipe and photos in this post, I veered off the meal plan calendar just a bit this week adding in some yellow bell peppers and tomatoes and then no olives. While I don’t mind having so many repeat meals in the month as it does help make meal planning easy for me, switching up an ingredient or two can really help the meal not feel so redundant.</p><p><br></p><p>Besides tasting great, these Power Bowls are also so incredibly healthy and good for you too! I love that these bowls are packed with fiber. Fiber is important to support hormone health, gut health, bowel regularity and blood sugar levels.</p><p><br></p><h3>Plant-Based Recipes For Kids</h3><p>My kids eat the same dinners that we do, however, I’ll offer the dinner in a different way. For example from this meal on a plate I added black beans, potatoes, yellow bell pepper, avocado and then a little salad with the dressing my kids prefer. Both my kids like the ingredients separated versus in a big bowl, so they enjoy a deconstructed version of this power bowl!</p><p><br></p><p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1450368588160-81c4b8955c8c?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=M3wzNTM2MDh8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw2fHxmaWJyZSUyMGZvb2R8ZW58MHx8fHwxNjg3MDg5ODM1fDA&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=400"></p><p><br></p><h3>How Does Fiber Support Gut Health</h3><p>Consuming foods with fiber is important for gut health, bowel regularity and immune health!
